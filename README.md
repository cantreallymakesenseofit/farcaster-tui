## Setup

### Reading (no signer needed)

Set your FID in settings (`?` key) to see your home feed. Without a FID, you'll see sample casts.

### Writing (signer required)

To publish casts, like, recast, or follow, you need an Ed25519 signer key registered to your Farcaster account.

1. Press `s` to open the signer manager
2. Press `i` to import a signer
3. Paste your Ed25519 private key (hex)
4. Enter your FID
5. Set an encryption password

Your signer key is encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored in `~/.config/farcaster-tui/signers.json`.

### How to get a signer key

Create a signer using [Warpcast](https://warpcast.com) or any Farcaster client that supports signer management. The private key is a 64-character hex string (32 bytes Ed25519).

## Configuration

Config is stored in `~/.config/farcaster-tui/config.json`:

```json
{
  "hubUrl": "https://hub.merv.fun",
  "fid": 12345
}
```

### Hub URL

The default hub is `https://hub.merv.fun`. You can change it in settings or by editing the config file. Some public hubs:

- `https://hub.merv.fun`
- `https://hub.pinata.cloud`
- `https://nemes.farcaster.xyz:2281`
